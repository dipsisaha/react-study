//** Pure component **//
Regular Component doesnot implement shouldComponentUpdate() method.
Pure Component always follow the shouldComponentUpdate() method with a shallow props and state comparison.
     SC of prevState with current State  != then re-render component
	 SC of prevProps with current Props  != then re-render component

In a nutshell if there is no difference , the component is re-render -it increase the performance boost.
It is agood idea that all children component should be purecomponent to avaoid the unexpected behavior.
never mutate the state,always return a new object that reflects the new state.


Same thing is doing in memocomponent for functional component
